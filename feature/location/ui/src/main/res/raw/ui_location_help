### How is this data calculated?
Positional shows you 5 different aspects of your location:

- Coordinates
- Accuracy
- Bearing
- Altitude
- Speed

Positional does not actually calculate any of these; it simply asks Android or Google Play Services
and your Android device for them and then displays them to you as they flow in. For your privacy,
Positional **never** records your location.

### Coordinates
This is your position on Earth, shown in whatever coordinate format you have selected. You can
adjust the format in Settings. The following formats are available:

- Decimal degrees
- Degrees with decimal minutes
- Degrees, minutes, and seconds
- MGRS
- UTM

These coordinates are determined using Android's or Google Play Services' "fused" approaches, using
data from various sources like GNSS (e.g. GPS, Galileo, BDS, GLONASS, IRNSS, or QZSS), cell towers,
and Wi-Fi networks.

### Accuracy
This is the accuracy of the coordinates above. It varies depending on the coordinates source (for
more info about sources, see above) and the current environment your Android device is located in.
For example, when you're outside with a clear view of the sky, you'll most likely have great GPS
reception and see great accuracies. When you're deep inside of a building surrounded by concrete,
steel, or other materials that interfere with GPS, cell, and WiFi signals, you'll most likely have
poor reception and see worse accuracies. Lower numbers are better for accuracy.

If you are _really_ interested in the technical meaning of this field, here is the documentation for
this data in Android, which is exactly what Positional uses:

>... the estimated horizontal accuracy radius in meters of this location at the 68th percentile
confidence level. This means that there is a 68% chance that the true location of the device is
within a distance of this uncertainty of the reported location. Another way of putting this is that
if a circle with a radius equal to this accuracy is drawn around the reported location, there is a
68% chance that the true location falls within this circle. This accuracy value is only valid for
horizontal positioning, and not vertical positioning.

### Bearing
This is the direction you are moving, regardless of orientation of your Android device. To minimize
distraction, speed and bearing are not shown when speed is 0.3 m/s (roughly 0.67 mph) or lower. This
is because accuracies are often poor enough for devices to think they are moving when they are not.

### Altitude
This is your current altitude above the WGS-84 ellipsoid (a rough approximation of Earth's surface).

### Speed
This is your current ground speed (not air speed). To minimize distraction, speed and bearing are
not shown when speed is 0.3 m/s (roughly 0.67 mph) or lower. This is because accuracies are often
poor enough for devices to think they are moving when they are not.

### Other Accuracies
If your device is running Android 8.0 or higher, Positional will also show you accuracies for each
of the position aspects listed at the top. You can hide these accuracies in Settings.
