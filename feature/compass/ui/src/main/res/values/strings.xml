    <string name="feature_compass_ui_missing_hardware_dialog_text">Most compass apps, like Positional, use a magnetometer that detects Earth\'s magnetic field just like a real compass uses a magnetic needle. We also use an accelerometer to determine how the device is oriented in the magnetic field (e.g. right side up or upside down). Unfortunately, your device is missing at least one of those sensors.</string>
