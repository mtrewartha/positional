### How are these readings calculated?
Sensor readings from your Android device's magnetometer and accelerometer are combined to determine
which direction your Android device is pointed in relation to magnetic north. If the compass is set
to true north mode, magnetic declination is also taken into account. See below for more details.

### How are magnetic north and true north different?
Earth's magnetic and true north poles aren't always aligned. In fact, the magnetic north pole drifts
over time as the earth's magnetic field changes. In contrast, the true north pole is based on the
imaginary axis that the earth rotates about, which means that it's much more stable. Positional can
show your compass reading in relation to either magnetic north or true north.

### What is magnetic declination?
It is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Earth's magnetic field is not uniform and it
changes over time. When the compass is set to true north mode, the current magnetic declination at
your location is added to the magnetic north reading so that the compass shows you readings relative
to true north instead of magnetic north.

### Why am I getting an accuracy warning?
The overall compass accuracy depends on the current accuracy of your Android device's magnetometer
and accelerometer. Readings from both sensors are combined to determine which direction you are
facing. If either sensor's accuracy falls to a low level, the warning will appear so that you do not
accidentally rely in a potentially inaccurate compass reading. To improve the accuracy of your
sensors and compass reading, you can move your device in a figure eight pattern, rotating your wrist
as you go. Magnets, metals, or any other objects that affect the magnetic field around your device
can also decrease accuracy.
