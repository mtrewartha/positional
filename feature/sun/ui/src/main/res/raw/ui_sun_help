### How are these times calculated?
The times are calculated using equations that model Earth's rotation about its own axis and around
the sun. Your current location and the date at your location are used as inputs into those
equations. The times shown are for the same time zone your Android device is set to.

### Sunrise & Sunset
Sunrise is when the sun is coming up from below the horizon. Sunset is when the sun is going down
below the horizon.

### Dawn & Dusk
Dawn is when the sun is rising and dusk is when the sun is setting. There are three types of dawn
and dusk times that Positional shows you. They differ in how many degrees below the horizon the sun
is:

- **Civil** dawn and dusk: 6° below
- **Nautical** dawn and dusk: 12° below
- **Astronomical** dawn and dusk: 18° below
